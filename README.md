INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:
After copying the TerraGen repository into your host machine, please enter the TerraGen-main folder.
Inside you will see the src and test directories. From there, you can open the TerraGen project in
your IDE of choice (IntelliJ was used for this project, and we garantee no results with other IDEs).
Your root directory in the IDE should be TerraGen-main.

Any other configuration may result in file path issues that will cause background images to not display.
